git reset . (removes staged files in current directory)
git reset <commitRef> (reset branch tip to commitRef and leave modified files unstaged)
git reset <commitRef> <fileName> (Leaves fileName staged at commitRef version and also modified to its pre-reset state.)
git reset --soft <commitRef> (reset branch tip to commitRef and leave modified files staged)
git reset --hard <commitRef> (reset branch tip to commitRef and reset files to commitRef)
git reset --hard (resets all modified files to their HEAD version)

// BRANCH VIEW AND MANIPULAITON
*******************************************
git branch  (displays local branches)

git branch -m <newName> (renames current branch)
git branch -d <branchName> (deletes branch)
git branch -D <branchName> (deletes an unmerged branch)

// FETCH / PULL / PUSH / CHERRY-PICK
*******************************************
git fetch (downloads branches and commits from upstream repo)
git fetch -p (The -p flag means "prune". After fetching, branches which no longer exist on the remote will be deleted.)

git pull (pulls changes from remote repo branch into local branch.)
git pull . <branchName> (pulls from local branch)
git pull --squash . <branch> (pulls committed changes from local <branch> into another branch without any of <branch> commit log.  Leaves the deltas staged)
git pull <branch> --no-commiit (perform merge but stop before making the commit)

git push . <branch_A>:<branch_B> (push to local branch)
git push -d origin <branch> deletes origin branch
git push --force-with-lease <branch> (push ammended commit message to remote)
git push origin --delete <branchName> (deletes remote branch)

git cherry-pick <commitID> (merges a specific commit)
git cherry-pick <commitId> --no-commit (perform merge but stop before making the commit)

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Advanced-Merging
git pull <branch> <-Xignore-all-space or -Xignore-space-change> (The first option ignores whitespace completely when comparing lines, the second treats sequences of one or more whitespace characters as equivalent.)

// STAGING FILE CHANGES FOR COMMIT
*******************************************
git add -A (stage all changes, including untracked files)
git add -u (stage all tracked items, ignoring untracked files)

// COMMITING CHANGES
*******************************************
git commit -a (stages and commits all tracked file changes, does not include untracked files)
git commit -m "commit message"
git commit --amend (to ammend the last commit message if the commit hasn't yet been pushed)

git remote -v (shows origin alias and path)
*** git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories  (optional: pull in any items before pushing)
git push -u <origin(Alias)> <branchName> (sets upstream tracking branch and pushes to it)
git branch -a (shows the new remote branch being tracked)
git remote remove <originAlias> (removes remote from local)

// STASHING CHANGES SO YOU CAN CHECKOUT ANOTHER BRANCH WIHTOUT COMMITING THOSE CHANGES
*******************************************

git stash list (shows stashes)
git stash pop (applies last stash)
git stash drop <stash_id> (remove the specific stash_id from the stash list)

git stash apply stash@{#} (# is a stack number as indicated from 'git stash list')

// GIT STATUS 
*******************************************
git status (shows status of current branch)
git status -uno (only shows modified repo items, not untracked files; means untracked=no)
git status .  (shows only the status of the current directory files)
git status "*textToMatch*" (only shows files with matching text)

// FILE & FOLDER OPERATIONS
*******************************************
git ls-files <*filenames*>  (shows files tracked by git)
git mv <oldFilename> <newFilename> (deletes file and adds file with new name, stages both changes for commit)
git rm <Filename>  (deletes file and stages the removal change for commit)
git rm --cached <filename> (stages a deletion of the file from the repo for commit, while leaving the file undeleted)
git clean -f (remove untracked files)

// DIFF FILES AND BRANCHES / SHOW
*******************************************
https://devconnected.com/how-to-compare-two-git-branches/
git diff <branch1>..<branch2> (compare the differences between the two branches.)
git diff <branch1>...<branch2> (compares the top of the right branch (the HEAD) with the common ancestor of the two branches.)
git diff <branch1>...<branch2> -- <filename>  (compares just the file named.  The -- indicates the end of command line flags.)
git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r <commit> (shows the file paths of all files changed in commit)
git diff --staged <filename> (shows diff for stated files)

git show <commit>  (shows all changes made in commit, from a diff perspective)
git show <commit> <file> | git apply (applies changes made in file at commit to current)

// LOG / REFLOG
*******************************************
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph (git ADOG acronym)
git log -<N> (shows last N log entries)
git log -- <file1> <file2> <fileN> (Shows the logs relating to the listed files)
git log -S"String To Search" (searches for commits that have text specified with string)
git log -G"RegularExpression" (searches for commits that have text specified with string)
git log --stat (displays the number of insertions and deletions to each file altered by each commit)
git log --raw -<N>  (show the last N logs, showing the files added to each commit)
git shortlog (a shorter display of the log entries)

git reflog (displays the history of HEAD pointer)
